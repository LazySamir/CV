## Samir Soormally

I live for a challenge and I love to help.

My background in psychology, both clinically and in a research capacity, has 
pushed me to understand and creatively solve complex problems in regards to 
people's lives. After several of years working in this field, I crave a new 
challenge. 

Since July 2017 I have been studying at Makers Academy, an intensive software 
development bootcamp, to equip me for my future developer roles. I would love to 
work with a passionate team where I am able to meaningully contribute and my 
professional development is encouraged.

## Skills

#### Good communication

I believe a team is only as strong as their communication. 

Understanding others and expressing yourself succinctly are keystones of good
therapeutic and professional relationships, whether this is written or verbal.
Developing these skills over my career have allowed me to work effectively with 
challenging clients as well as multidisciplinary teams with widely differing 
philosophies on psychological treatment.

I feel confident in my ability to work and get along with all types of people 
and believe this will make me a solid member of any team.

#### Fast and dedicated learner

Despite a heavy caseload in my previous psychological role, I was recommended
by my line manager to work with a high-risk adolescent cohort in the evenings, 
something I had no experience of. I was trusted to find a way to learn new
techniques and adapt my current knowledge in a short timeframe.

Due to time constraints, I decided to listen to pdf versions of textbooks while 
driving my daily commute to work. My quick learning and effective use of time 
allowed me to meet the needs of the clients while maintaining my other 
responsibilities.
